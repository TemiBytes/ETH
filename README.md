# Ethereum Analytics Pipeline

A production-ready ELT pipeline built with dbt Core and Snowflake on 
real Ethereum transaction data from the AWS Public Blockchain Dataset.

Raw Parquet files land in Snowflake as semi-structured VARIANT payloads. 
dbt transforms them through a three-layer architecture into six 
analytical mart tables — all tested, documented, and deployed via 
a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

## What This Pipeline Produces

| Mart | Description |
|---|---|
| `whale_alert` | Large ETH transfers classified by tier and ranked daily by USD value |
| `gas_price_trends` | Daily gas fee analytics split by EIP-1559 vs legacy fee model |
| `active_wallets` | Behavioural profiles for every wallet in the dataset |
| `contract_leaderboard` | Smart contracts ranked by interaction count and ETH received |
| `block_activity` | Network throughput and congestion metrics per block |
| `failed_tx_analysis` | Failed transactions with failure reason and gas cost wasted |

## Tech Stack

- **dbt Core** — transformation framework
- **Snowflake** — data warehouse
- **AWS S3** — public blockchain data source
- **GitHub Actions** — CI/CD pipeline

---

## Data Source

The raw data comes from the [AWS Public Blockchain Dataset](https://registry.opendata.aws/aws-public-blockchain/), 
a publicly available S3 bucket maintained by AWS. No credentials required.

Transactions are loaded daily using a Snowflake scripted procedure that 
pulls the previous day's high-value transactions (value > 10 ETH) from 
the S3 stage into the raw landing table.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Every pull request triggers a GitHub Actions workflow that:

1. Spins up a fresh Ubuntu environment
2. Installs dbt Core and the Snowflake adapter
3. Authenticates to Snowflake using RSA key pair authentication
4. Runs `dbt build` against the dev schema — models and tests in DAG order
5. Fails the PR if any model or test fails

Branch-based target switching ensures dev branches always run against 
the dev schema. Only code merged to master touches the production schema.

---

## Running This Project

**Prerequisites**
- dbt Core installed (`pip install dbt-core dbt-snowflake`)
- A Snowflake account with the raw table set up (see `eth.sql` in the repo)
- RSA key pair configured in your `profiles.yml`

**Setup**
```bash
# Install dependencies
dbt deps

# Test your connection
dbt debug

# Run the full pipeline
dbt build -s stg_eth_transactions+
```
